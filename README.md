API Trakt.TV
============

Author: modmax

This is a java library to use the API for the [TraktTV](http://www.trakt.tv/) website.

This API is an enhancement of [trakt-java](https://github.com/UweTrottmann/trakt-java)
and uses jackson and apache http client to match the other apis which are used by YAMJ.
